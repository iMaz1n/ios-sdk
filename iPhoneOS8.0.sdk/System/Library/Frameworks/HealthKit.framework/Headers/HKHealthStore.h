 @discussion    Before attempting to execute queries or save objects, the application should first request authorization
                from the user to read and share every type of object for which the application may require access.
 
                The request is performed asynchronously and its completion will be executed on an arbitrary background
                queue after the user has responded.  If the user has already chosen whether to grant the application
                access to all of the types provided, then the completion will be called without prompting the user.
                The success parameter of the completion indicates whether prompting the user, if necessary, completed
                successfully and was not cancelled by the user.  It does NOT indicate whether the application was
                granted authorization.
